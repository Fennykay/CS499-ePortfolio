          <h3>Introduction to Skillset</h3>
          <p>
            I began my journey as a developer back in 2021, when I enrolled in
            Southern New Hampshire University(SNHU). While in this program, I
            have learned a plethora of concepts and skills that have aided me as
            a person, and a developer. Such things as being cautious, organzied,
            and detail-oriented have been key to my success in this program and
            in my life as a whole.
            <br />
            <br />
            The program has helped shaped who I want to be as a developer by
            exposing me to a variety of languages and concepts, allowing me to
            find my niche in the field and help develop my passion for computers
            and the tech field. This Portfolio has allowed me to specifically
            showcase my skills with C++ and learning new frameworks with Qt.
            <br />
            <br />
            CS465, Fullstack Development, and CS340, Client Server Development,
            were classes that allowed me to become more practiced and
            comfortable with database implementation and maintenance. I was able
            to garner a more complete understanding of how databases work and
            how to implement them in a variety of ways. Securing data and
            ensuring that it is safe and secure is a key aspect of the tech
            field and I am glad to have learned these skills, as they were
            rather vital to this project and my growth as a developer. All of
            this was paied with proper security measures and ensuring that the
            data was safe and secure. Proper data security is vital to
            protecting the data of the users and ensuring that it is not
            compromised in any way.
            <br />
            <br />
            CS300, Data Structures and Algorithms, was instrumental in my
            understand of Data Structures and Algorithms. The class allowed me
            to understand how to implement and use data structures and
            algorithms in a variety of ways that were both efficient and
            effective. I was introduced to many concepts such as linked lists,
            stacks, queues, and trees, as well as searching and sorting
            algorithms.
            <br />
            <br />
            CS250, Software Development Lifecycle, was a class that taught me
            how to properly integrate in a team and work on a project from start
            to finish. This showing the importance of proper planning and
            organization in a project and how to properly implement and maintain
            a project, alongside other developers. This class also helped teach
            me how to properly illustate and communicate with stakeholders on
            meetable metrics and goals for the project.
            <br />

          <h3>Introduction to Project</h3>
          <p>
            The artefact that we chose to represent was a Contact Application,
            it was composed of some simple Java classes that were created as a
            "cookie cutter" beginning of the project. It's initial design was
            for a Command Line Interface application that was simple and easy to
            use. The goal was for it to allow a user to Create and manage
            contacts, Tasks, and Appointments.
            <br />
            <br />
            We aspired to take this and make it into a full fledged application
            that would allow for a user to manage all of the same things, but
            with actual functionality that the first iteration did not have. All
            fo this also coming with a GUI that would allow for a user to
            interact with the application in a more user friendly way,
            understandable way.
            <br />
            <br />
            This GUI will be created through the use of the Qt framework, with
            C++

              <h3>Notes</h3>
              <p>
                The above images show the state of the initial Java class
                creation and the extent of what was represented in the initial
                design. As noted in the code review, this is missing a lot of
                functionality and is not a complete project, which is why we
                selected this. I felt this would be the best example of my
                skills and growth as a developer, to take a project that was not
                near complete and make it into a full fledged application.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <h4>Software Design and Engineering Narrative</h4>
              <p>
                This project was designed to be the starting classes of a
                Contact Application, it is made in Java and was crafted when I
                was in CS320.
                <br />
                <br />
                This was included because I felt it would be good for showcasing
                my ability to take a project and improve its overall design. The
                goal was to turn this into a fully interactive application and
                we have done that through giving this a working GUI and
                completely moving it over to C++. This equipped me to learn new
                techniques, and master old ones, such as
                Model-View-Controller(MVC) pattern , dynamic content updating,
                event handling, and custom widget usage. This process also
                required constant testing and debugging and design prowess to
                implement.
              </p>
              <h4>Algorithms and Data Structure Narrative</h4>
              <p>
                This project was designed to be a simple contact application
                that would allow for a user to manage contacts, tasks, and
                appointments. This was included because it was a project that
                was not complete and needed to be improved upon. This project
                required the use of data structures and algorithms to properly
                implement the functionality that was desired. To complete the
                need for searching, we implemented a custom algorithm to allow
                for us to search through substrings of object names, or dates,
                to find matching elements for the user. This allows for us to
                return any thing resembling the search query, instead of
                returning only items that match the search query exactly. C++
                does come with sorting methods built in but we also implemented
                our own sorting algorithm to allow for a representation of our
                ability to implement algorithms and data structures.
              </p>
              <h4>Databases Narrative</h4>
              <p>
                This improvement was added to allow for the user to have data be
                stored in a way that takes the load off of the on board memory
                for the computer. This allows for the user to have a larger
                amount of data stored in the application and not have to worry
                about constantly having the application open to keep the data.
                Our application does not have any network capabilities, and is
                all hosted locally, so we did not need to utilize a more
                advanced method of database storage, we were able use SQLite to
                store the data locally on the computer. This allowed for us to
                have a database that was easy to implement and use.

              <h3>Improvement Narrative</h3>
              <p>
                The above is the culmination of the project, a fully interactive
                contact application. This was probably the most complete project
                I have created to date, this takes all the pieces of a compelete
                piece of Software and puts them together in a way that is
                somewhat intuitive and easy to use.
                <br />
                <br />
                I would assert that there are certainly areas for improvement
                still, such as the design of the application, and the overall
                functionality of the application but this is a good starting
                point for me to continue to grow and develop as a developer. The
                difference between the starting artefact and this product is
                miles in terms of functionality and design. I, as a developer,
                have grown in the same manner. Learning Qt was a challenge, as I
                had no prior knowledge before this project, but I was able to
                learn and implement it in an easy to digest and use way.
                <br />
                <br />
                All of our goals were met in this project, as we were able to
                utilize a database for storing user data, the Software Design
                and Engineering were overhauled and given a much more pleaseing
                look, and the Algorithms and Data Structures were implemented in
                a way that allowed for the user to have a more intuitive
                experience for searching and sorting through their data.

            This project was a milestone for me as a developer, it was the first
            project I took from beginning to (early version) end. There will
            always be more progress but this is a project that has reached it's
            1.0.0 version. The process for this project was more than just
            syntax conversion; it involved many late nights of learning a new
            framework and designing a whole application. Our Contact Application
            allowed me to further enhance my skills with memory allocation,
            pointer management, and low-level programming.
            <br /><br />
            I am a better developer because of this.
            <br /><br />
            Learning the Qt Framework was a critical challenege for this project
            to get off the ground. I had no prior knowledge of the framework
            before this project and had to learn it from the ground up. The
            reward was well worth the challenge, despite the mistakes and
            misdesigns that I had to correct along the way.
            <br /><br />
            Overall, this project is my current cornerstone for development. My
            technical skills have grown, and so has my ability to learn. The
            challenges faced, and overcome, have equipped me with the tools to
            take on new challenges and projects in the future.
